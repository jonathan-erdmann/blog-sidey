## Thoughts
- Wager scaling with half Kelly Bet sizing is the only risk aversion mechanism used so far
- Additional risk aversion considerations will be added to the betting strategy
- Different sports may require unique strategy elements
- The expected profit/loss distributions by day are highly variable
- There will be significant losses on betting days in the future!
- Positive return after four betting days is not conclusive - many more days are necessary
